# todo-cli

This is a very, _very_ simple todo list manager.

## How it works

It makes a dotfile (`.todos.ron`) in the working directory where it stores the todos.

## TODO (how ironic)

- [x] Add a task
- [x] Edit a task
- [x] Remove a task
- [x] List all tasks
- [ ] Recursively list all tasks
- [x] Mark a task as done
- [x] Mark a task as not done
