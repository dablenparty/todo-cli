# todo-cli

This is a very, _very_ simple todo list manager.

## How it works

It makes a dotfile (`.todo`) in the working directory where it stores the todos.

## TODO (how ironic)

- [ ] Add a task
- [ ] Edit a task
- [ ] Remove a task
- [ ] List all tasks
- [ ] Recursively list all tasks
- [ ] Mark a task as done
- [ ] Mark a task as not done
